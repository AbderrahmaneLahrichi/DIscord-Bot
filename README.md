# Discord Bot

Here we have a discord bot that displays a randomized cat or do image depending on Whether you use the !dog or !cat  commands. We also consider if the user accidentally used a capital letter int their spelling.

# Future game updates:
In the future I am looking to make the discord bot more versatile and allow  for admins to  kick players, ban player, put players in time out, play mini games, and  give statistics of the server. I am looking to make this discord bot used worldwide.
