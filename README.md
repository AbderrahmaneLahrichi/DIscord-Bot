#Discord Bot

Here we have a discord bot that displays a randomized cat or do image depending on Whether you use the! dog or! cat commands. We also consider if the user accidentally used a capital letter in their spelling. 

This discord bot is not being hosted on any platforms currently, so if users want to use the bot, they will need to download the code and run the program on their own machines. This projects used the Node.js which is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. The project uses both  discord.js  rest API and  the user will need to install it. I will leave instructions on how to install everything. 

## Installation for the Project:

### Install VSCode
- Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows.
- Once it is downloaded, run the installer (VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe). This will only take a minute.
- By default, VS Code is installed under C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code.

### Install Node.js:
- Download the latest version from the https://nodejs.org/en, open the package installer, and follow the instructions

### Install Discord.js:
- To use discord.js, you'll need to install it via npm (Node's package manager). npm comes with every Node installation, so you don't have to worry about installing that. However, before you install anything, you should set up a new project folder.
- Navigate to a suitable place on your machine and create a new folder named discord-bot (or whatever you want). Next you'll need to open your terminal.

#### Opening the Terminal on Windows Either:
- Shift + Right-click inside your project directory and choose the "Open command window here" option
or 
- Press Win + R and run cmd.exe, and then cd into your project directory

#### Once you have the Terminal you have to make sure have the correct version of Node.js
- With the terminal open, run the node -v command to make sure you've successfully installed Node.js. If it outputs v16.9.0 or higher, great!

#### Initiating a Project Folder:
```bash
   npm init
```
 ```bash
     npm init -y
```
 ```bash
  npm install discord.js
```

# Future game updates:
The code is written in JS and any future work will be done within JS to keep it all in the same realm. In the future I am looking to make the discord bot more versatile and allow for admins to kick players, ban player, put players in time out, play mini games, and  give statistics of the server. I am looking to make this discord bot used worldwide. If people want to create certain actions for the bot they can inform me and I will start working on it. However, if people are looking to add to the bots actions they can write it in any code they want and it will be translated back into JavaScript.
